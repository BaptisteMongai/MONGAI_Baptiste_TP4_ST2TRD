1. What is this code about?
This code is an inventory management with different objects, the time remaining before expiry and their quality.

2. Can you clearly identify the name of all the goods stored in the Guilded Rose?
It is not very clear but, here is the inventory:
+5 Dexterity Vest
Aged Brie
Elixir of the Mongoose
2 x Sulfuras, Hand of Ragnaros
3 x Backstage passes to a TAFKAL80ETC concert
Conjured Mana Cake

3. What happens when the day is over?
When then day is over :
- sellIn decrease of 1 (can be negative) for all the goods except "Sulfuras, Hand of Ragnaros".
- quality is update:
    * For +5 Dexterity Vest: -1 each day it is not expired and -2 each day it is expired. Min = 0.
    * For Conjured Mana Cake and Elixir of the Mongoose: -1 every day and -2 when going from 0 to -1. Min = 0.
    * For Sulfuras, Hand of Ragnaros: Always 80.
    * For Backstage passes: +1 when SellIn >10, +2 when SellIn in [5-10[ and +3 when SellIn lower than 5. Max 50. 0 after the concert.
    * For Aged Brie: +1 each day it is not expired and +2 each day it is expired. Max 50.

4. What happens to cheese when the day is over?
Answer in 3.

5. What happens when a concert ticket goes over its expiration day?
His quality drop to 0.

6. What makes this code hard to read?
It is hard to read because for each iteration we have all the goods names, sellIN and quality, so it's hard to focus
just on one product.

7. Do you think the rules are clear enough so that you could rework the entire solution
from scratch?
No. Here are some anclear rules:
    - "Sulfuras", being a legendary item, never has to be sold or decreases in Quality
        -> never has to be sold means 0, -1, none value, we don't know.
    - "Mana Cake" has no rules
    - "Conjured" items degrade in Quality twice as fast as normal items
        -> Conjured Mana Cake have no normal items Mana Cake.
